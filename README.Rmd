# Vision

Select NFL players for a high-scoring Fantasy Team with an easy-to-use dashboard

# Goals

-   Show data available as searchable, sortable, and filterable tables

-   Visualize performance of (multiple) players

    -   Across plays (play-by-play per game)

    -   Across games (game-level stats per season)

# Questions

-   What metrics in the data quantify performance?Â 

-   Do combinations of metrics better represent player performance?
